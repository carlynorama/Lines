The chatter of little people|https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/13213/aliens
Breaks on my purpose|https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/13213/aliens
Like the water-drops which slowly wear the rocks to powder.|https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/13213/aliens
And while I laugh|https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/13213/aliens
My spirit crumbles at their teasing touch.|https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/13213/aliens
